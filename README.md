# Data Analytics Tools

This Python code is designed for a lab exercise focusing on two primary objectives: first, to familiarize the learner with the:

-   `iloc` function in pandas for subsetting datasets
    
-   The creation of functions in Python.
    

## Getting started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following utilities installed on your system:

-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
    
-   Git
    

### Installing:

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`git clone <repository_url>`

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

`cd <project_directory>`

Open the notebook using a Jupyter Notebook server by running:

`jupyter-notebook Lab6_week8.ipynb`

This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to the notebook file and interact with the code.

## Running Tests

While tests are not currently included in the code, we encourage contributors to add tests to verify the functionality of the codebase. You can use testing frameworks such as [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) or [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/) to write and execute tests for the functions provided. To run tests, follow these steps:

1. Write test cases to cover different scenarios and expected outcomes.

2. Implement test functions using a testing framework of your choice.

3. Execute the test suite to verify that the code behaves as expected.

4. If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, investigate and make necessary adjustments to the codebase.

Contributors are encouraged to maintain and update the test suite as the codebase evolves. Including thorough tests helps ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.

## Deployment

To deploy this code and make it accessible to others, follow these instructions:

- **Convert to HTML**: Convert the Jupyter Notebook file (Lab6_week8.ipynb) to an HTML file using the nbconvert utility. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`jupyter nbconvert --to html Lab6_week8.ipynb`
This will generate an HTML version of your notebook.

- **Host Online**: Host the HTML file on any web server or online platform. You can use services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), Netlify, or any other web hosting service. Simply upload the HTML file to your chosen platform and ensure it's accessible via a URL.

- **Share the Link**: Once the HTML file is hosted online, share the link with others who need access to the code. They can view the notebook content by visiting the provided URL in their web browser.

By following these steps, you can easily deploy your code and make it available to others for viewing and interaction.

## Built With

-   **Python**: The code is written in Python, using libraries such as Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
    
-   **Jupyter Notebook**: The code is structured in a Jupyter Notebook format, which allows for a combination of executable code cells and Markdown cells for documentation and explanation.
